[ ] Add install instructions.

[ ] Make form tabbing "save state." Right now after submit, user is returned to
    first tab no matter which tab was submitted.

[ ] Reduce tabs as suggested by ErikRose:
    12:52 < ErikRose> Seems to me you could just have 2 tabs: CSS and JavaScript. In each is an edit field and a "[X] JavaScript
                      debug mode" or "[X] CSS debug mode"
    12:52 <@esteele> Agreed.
    12:53 < aclark> k
    12:53 < ErikRose> Nice work, aclark!
    12:53 < aclark> In 0.3 then :-)
    12:53 < ErikRose> A definite win.
