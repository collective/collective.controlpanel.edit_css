[ ] Custom the right ploneCustom.css, as suggested by Eric Steele.
        10:39 <@esteele> aclark: And as far as edit_css in Plone 4.x, I'd like to see
                it modify ploneCustom.css.
        10:40 < aclark> esteele: That's what it does
        10:40 < aclark> (and ploneCustom.js)
        10:41 <@esteele> Oh? I'd expected to see the contents of Sunburst's
                ploneCustom when I first viewed it.
        10:42 <@esteele> Ah, so if there's not a ploneCustom.css in custom, it just
                creates one?
        10:42 < aclark> esteele: It creates an empty ploneCustom.css… but yeah… yes
        10:42 <@esteele> Could I suggest walking the skin layers to find the first
                instance?
        10:42 < aclark> sure
        10:43 < aclark> I'll add a todo

[ ] Fix browser form processing as described in 
    http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/ScriptingZope.html#passing-parameters-to-scripts

[ ] Add install instructions.

[ ] Make html form tabbing "save state." Right now after submit, user is returned to
    first tab no matter which tab was submitted.

[ ] Reduce tabs as suggested by ErikRose:
        12:52 < ErikRose> Seems to me you could just have 2 tabs: CSS and JavaScript. 
                In each is an edit field and a "[X] JavaScript debug mode" or "[X] CSS debug mode"
        12:52 <@esteele> Agreed.
        12:53 < aclark> k
        12:53 < ErikRose> Nice work, aclark!
        12:53 < aclark> In 0.3 then :-)
        12:53 < ErikRose> A definite win.
